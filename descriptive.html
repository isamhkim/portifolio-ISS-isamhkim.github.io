To evaluate what we've learned, we were given an exercise to study one of the protocols seen during the theorical classes: the <b>Bluetooth Low Energy</b>. We had to make an analysis of its modulation, paquet structure, frequency range, calculation of the indoor and outdoor propagation range, etc. <br> <br>
                            Alongside with Fu Yimin, Noël Taillardat, and Poonkuzhali Pajanissamy I worked on writting the report, and doing the calculations on indoor and outdoor propagations for the frequency ranges.

                            We learned more about the IoT architecture, the practical attacks, threats and risks and how they could be prevented. <br><br>
                            However, as it remains a purely theoretical course, I don't think I could be able to apply this knowledge quickly.

                            <p class="bd">This course was divided into theorical lessons and practical works. During the lectures, we learned about emerging networks, in particular the SDN and NDN.
                            <br><br>
                            The idea of WSN technologies is to collect data data from remote devices (sensor, nodes). So the biggest limitations in this type of technologies comes from the nature of its own components. WSN are subjected to power supply limitations, low power and lossy network (LLN) and memory limitations.
                            <br><br>
                            To address this limitation, the SDN became a new networking paradigm that has been evolving through the years. The traditional routing protocols are substituted by a new centralized approach where the control of the network is transferred to some central elements, called “controllers”. They determine the flux and inform decision through a plane controller layer.
                            <br><br>
                            During the practical works we could implement the knowledge acquired during the lectures.

                            <p class="bd"> In this module we learned about <b>Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</b>, architecture which consists in the creation of services (i.e., functionalities) that can be implemented by application components using a communication protocol via a network. So these services can be accessed remotely and acted upon. <br><br> 

                            First of all, we studied and we deployed applications using Services Web <b>SOAP</b>, <b>BPEL</b> and <b>Service RESTful</b>. All these three architectures are made to allow Web services in a service-oriented architecture (SOA) to interconnect and share data. <br><br> 

                            After that, as a final project for this module we made an application capable of <b> managing automatically INSA’s rooms</b>. The application is capable of automatically turning on/off all the computers in a room, the heaters and closing/opening the shutters. These actions are based on the information received from sensors located in these rooms. For the organisation of this project we used the Agile method, defining sprints accordingly to our advancements on the project.

                                A wide range of technologies work together to connect things in the Internet of Things (IoT) and there are lots of existing wired and wireless protocols such as Ethernet, Rs-232, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular, Zig Bee, Z-Wave, Thread, 802.15.4, 6LoWPAN, Sigfox, LoRaWAN, etc. In this module we learned about <b>OneM2M, which is an open-source platform that ensures the interoperability of M2M and IoT services</b>. With this tool we could make devices using different technologies communicate between themselves thanks to this Middleware solution.

                            <p class="bd"> Cloud computing is a very recurrent term in the Internet of Things domain. It basically consists in the delivery of hosted services — such as servers, databases, networking, software, etc — over the Internet (“the cloud”). In the first part of this course, we learned about Virtual Machines and Containers: how they work, how they’re implemented, what can they do and how to deploy them. <br><br>
                                
                            In the following part, we learned more about the concept of "cloud" by provisioning end-user applications in different cloud applications: Google Cloud, Cloud Foundry and Jelastic. <br><br>

                            <p class="bd"> Software engineering is really important to design, develop, maintain and test a computer software. And it’s a really important part of our formation to get to know techniques and tools that could help us as engineers to develop projects in an efficient way. <br><br>

                            Several development methods were presented to us during the software engineering course: waterfall, iterative spiral development, <b>V-model</b> and <b>Agile method</b>. These methods aims to optimise project development life cycle and avoiding risks and preventing risks and in the final delivery product. <br><br>

                            During the Autonomous Vision project and the INSA’s rooms management project, we could put into practice the concepts showed to us during this classes. <br><br>

                            <p class="bd"> The Semantic Web is an area that is becoming increasingly important in IT and IoT. With the volume of data increasing exponentially comes the need to establish more and more relations between these data so we can create more intelligent and interoperable devices. The aim is to enrich collected data by linking it to <b>ontologies</b> and to <b>facilitate the exchange of data in the IoT field</b>. So, the semantic data is a treatment of data process based on creating relationships 
                            between symbols (the data) and the real world. 
                            <br> <br>
                            In this course module, we had theoretical classes to learn the basic principles of data semantics and then two TP sessions where we could apply what we’d learned. To see more about the work developed on this module, feel welcome to click on the button below: <br>

                            <p class="bd"> During this course we learned about how data can be analysed computationally to <b>reveal patterns, trends, and associations </b>, related to the world we live in. Through the theoretical courses we learned about the fundamental principles of big data, including statistical formulations and important theorems. <br><br>
                            We also learned about how to use the <b>R programming language</b> to manipulate big volumes of data and we could put the theoretical knowledge into practice during the TP sessions. <br><br>
                            At the end of this module I teamed up with Vu Diep to analyse a big open source dataset using all the skills we learned during the practical works. To get more information about the work we did, please click on the button below: <br>

                            This project is part of our 5th year Innovative and Smart Systems (ISS) teaching program, taking part in the Innovative project module. The idea is to put into practice our technical skills acquired during our time at INSA, as well as an approach to other aspects of our formation, such as communication, teamwork and project management.

                            This project consisted in <b>prototyping an autonomous embedded solution capable of recognizing images and transmitting data</b>. More specifically, it should be able to read machine indicators (digits, gauges), process the computing image on board and only transmit deciphered data. We focused on <b>LCD’s digits recognition</b> and basing our solution on <b>Neural Networks</b> to recognize data.

                            These digits read could represent temperature from real LCD screens, as from refrigerators of restaurants and food industries. The motivation behind this project is to propose <b>an innovative and smart way to monitor and transmit data from those indicators, to avoid food from being spoiled unnecessarily</b>.<br><br>
                                
                            With this autonomous vision project, we had the opportunity to work in an innovative project with an actual client from the industry, Ludovic Tancerel representant of the <b>Wiifor company</b>. <br><br>
