                            <p class="bd">To achieve the goal of implementing a communicating gas sensor, first I had to get familiarized with the <b>KiCad EDA software</b>. This open-source software was used in order to make the schematics and the PCB design of the Arduino shield containing the gas detector. <br>
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: center">
                            <img class="center" align="middle" src="./images/Kicad_logo.png" width="200" style="align: middle; margin: 20px">
                            </p>
                            <p class="bd">The first part consisted on the conception of the <b>electronic circuit schematic</b> representing our system. The circuit is composed of the gas sensor, an impedance adaptation phase (containing the operational amplifier LT1050) to adapt the gas sensor values to the ADC entry of the Arduino Uno board, and the Lora module RN2483. <br>
                            Some of these compoenents weren't present in the given libraries of Kicad so we had to create them based on their datasheet information. 
                            <br>
                            This final schematic is shown in the figure below:<br>
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: center">
                            <img class="center" align="middle" src="./images/Kicad_Schema.PNG" width="650" style="align: middle; margin: 20px">
                            </p>
                            <p class="bd">After that, we could associate the components of the circuit to footprints of real components (capacitor, resistors, etc) to then generate the PCB. With the generated PCB components, we had to position properly the elements on the shield to make the connections and make the routings. Regarding the routings, we decided to use the upper and the lower layer for a more clear design as shown in the following figure.<br>
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: center">

                            </p>
                            <p class="bd">With that done we could also obtain a 3D visualization of our shield:<br>
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: center">
                            <img class="center" align="middle" src="./images/Kicad_3D.PNG" width="640" style="align: middle; margin: 20px; padding-top: 20px">
                            </p>
                            <p class="bd">In addition to that, on the <b>Arduino UNO part</b>: we first had to put into practice our soldering skills to integrate the <b>LoRa module LNR483</b> to a PCB that could then be connected to the Arduino. With the LoRa module and the gas sensor connected, we could collect the data from the sensor visualizing it on a dashboard in <b>The Things Network</b> platform. The code for the Arduino and the Kicad files are all available on the Github repository below.<br><br>

It was one of my favorite courses from this semester because we were able to do a <b>complete project from bottle to top</b>: since actually fabricating the sensor, making the conception of a schematic circuit, the PCB, integrating the sensor into a connected IoT context. <br> <br>
                            As my group for this project was really well divided into specialities, the parts of the project could be really well divided. That was good because no one got overloaded in work and each one concentrated on its part but that also meant that I didn’t get involved to deep into the part of the LoRa module. This part I had to catch on later.

                            We also learned about connected objects from a <b>security</b> aspect: confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. <br>

                            <p class="bd" style="padding-bottom: 30px"> In this course, groups made presentations about different communication protocols: <b>Sigfox</b>, <b>LoRa</b>, <b>Zigbee</b>, <b>Bluetooth Low Energy</b> and <b>NB-Iot</b>. From these presentations we could learn about multiple protocols as well as make a comparison between them. <br><br>
                            For this course, I teamed up with Diep Vu on a presentation of the Narrowband-IoT protocol focusing on the aspects about the: physical layer, MAC layer, power consumption, security, routing and mobility. <br><br>
                            We elaborated a detailed report to explain our research on these points as well as a power point presentation, both of them are available below for consultation.

Since different applications have different requirements, WSNs will employ a family of communication standards. MAC layer is a major reason to provide the reliability and efficiency for WSN. In WSN we need a MAC protocol to consider energy efficiency, reliability, low access delay and high throughput as major priorities. <br>

                                This course consisted on practical works where we studied the modulation and demodulation of real AM and FM radio signals through a <b>Software Defined Radio (SDR)</b> approach. SDR is a technology of electromagnetic signal modulation and demodulation that allows us to perform signal processing tasks that are typically done by hardware, using software. <br><br>
                                During the TPs, we worked with a National Instruments <b> National Instruments USRP-2900 software defined radio transceiver </b> and a software called <b>GNU Radio</b>, which works with functional blocks that provide various signal processing functions. This way we can implement different signal processing functions in a really simple and easy way. <br> <br>
                                During the classes, firstly we demonstrated that, in  the  case  of narrowband  signals,  the  IQ  transceivers  (Inphase/Quadrature) allow  transmissions  with  frequency transportation  without altering data. After that, we worked on a real time demodulation of an FM broadcasting signal and a VOLMET AM signal. <br> <br>
                                The practical works were made individually but for the final report (shown below) me and Diep Vu worked together.

                                Thanks to the Wireless Digital Communication lectures, I learned about the existing wireless technologies, and what were their strengths and weaknesses and what are the main characteristics that define them. I really liked the format of the course which was really <b>dynamic</b> and it seemed more like an active discussion than a passive-learning tradition lecture. Now I believe I'm able to understand the <b>fundamentals of each protocol</b>. Also in this course, we learned more about <b>how to be more critical during research</b>, taking always into consideration sources and being critical about the data being provided. This was a really interesting aspect of the course for me because we could see some contraditions in articles and exercise <b>more critical thinking</b>.<br><br> 
                                During the 5G opening presentations, I feel like I learned a lot about 5G. But what I enjoyed the most was how with some of the presentations, we saw the impact that emerging networks were going to have on the society of tomorrow. And <b>thinking about the consequences of developing new technologies</b> is essential for the formation of an engineer. As engineers ous actions can have lots of social and political impacts.<br><br>
                                About security for connected objects, I believe I understood the principles of security during the lectures. But I wish we'd had the opportunity to apply some of these theorical lessons in lab sessions to <b>have a concrete experience in the IoT security field</b>. <br><br>
                                Concerning the energing networks classes, I thought it was a really interesting concept to approach during the teaching program. Whatsoever the lectures could be really hard to follow for people with not a good network background. <br><br>

                            <p class="bd"> For this project I teamed up with Noël Taillardart and Poonkuzhali Pajanissamy on the creation of a <b>smart building application capable of managing INSA’s rooms</b>: turning on/off lights, computers, heaters and opening/closing windows automatically or manually by the user. Our application is also capable of receiving a schedule to implement all these actions cited before. <br> <br>
                            Our first step was defining the architecture of our system. In the figure below we show a diagram containing the actual deployment of the architecture of our system: 
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: center">

                            <p class="bd"> So in our defined architecture, our Infrastructure Node (IN) ins INSA’s campus, our Middle Nodes (MNs) are floors at GEI’s building and our Application Entities (AEs) are the rooms in each floor, that’s where our actuators and sensors are located. To make an abstraction of this architecture and test our system we used <b>Node-RED</b> to create all these elements on the <b>OM2M platform</b> (see figure below). </p>
                            <p style="text-align: center">

                            <p class="bd"> To interact with the lights, computers, shutters and windows of the rooms we created aUser Interface as shown in the figure below. So when actions are received via the User Interface, the microservices (coded in Java using the Eclipse Neon 3 IDE) send http requests to handle the actions.</p>

                                <i>My role:</i> In this project, apart from the conception and management part, I worked on coding the microservices to implement the actions of the actuators using <b>Java</b> programming language and the <b>Eclipse Neon 3 IDE</b>. <br><br>
                                 Also, in this project we could apply project management methods, in particularly: the Agile method. I you're curious to see more details about this project, please feel free to ckek out our report below:

                                This project was one of my favorites of this semester, I found the use case to be really interesting.  And it really helped me understand <b>how a middleware architecture works </b> during the conception of the architecture phase. It was a good way to <b>put together all the knowledge that we learned in the Middleware and Services training</b>. Thus, I feel really confident on the skills mobilised in deploying web services.

                            <p class="bd"> During the practical works, we took some time in the first sessions to understand how the <b>OM2M architecture</b> (the nodes, applications) are deployed in the platform. We could see how a GUI simulating switching on and off lamps (see figure below) caused changes in real time on the correspondent OM2M architecture. <br><br>
                            We were able to deploy simple IoT architectures and interact with OM2M resources via http protocols. To send the http requests we used a <b>Postman software</b> that allowed us to send GET, POST, PUT and DEL in a simple way. 
                            Also, we learned how to use the <b>Node-RED tool</b> to generate the nodes and application in the OM2M platform (see figure below).

                            <p class="bd"> In the last practical work, we introduced Philips Hue Lamps (Zigbee technology) into our existing IoT architecture and we used an IPE (Interworking Proxy Entity) to translate the device technology to the oneM2M standard in a way that the systems could communicate. So we could turn on/off the Philips lamp and change its color. <br><br>

                            This module was really important to understand many base concepts of IoT, the machine to machine communication and interoperability and the REST services. Many of the technical aspects explored in this module were used for other works in this UF. It was really important to do these activities before doing the INSA's rooms management, for example. <br><br>
                            Another thing I enjoyed was the <b>OM2M MOOC classes</b>. I thought it was more efficient learning these concepts at my own pace and doing mini exercises at my own rythm than attending lectures. I felt really prepared to the TPs by doing the MOOC lessons.

                                I found this course to be very useful and interesting because my Innovation Project, I had to deploy a Virtual Machine and Docker environments. These were new concepts to me and it would have helped me to have learned about them earlier. But at the same time the Innovation project I worked on this semester is a real proof of <b>how relevant and useful the concepts seen in this module are</b>. <br><br>
                                I really enjoyed the way the TPs were made. Whatsover, the second part of the practical works went really fast and it was really interesting, I wish we spent more time on it to develop more my skills in this domain that is so relevant.

                            <p  class="bd"> During our main project of the semester, the Autonomous Vision project made in partnership with the company Wiifor, we adopted the <b>Agile method</b>: creating sprints and defining stories using the organization <b>platform Redmine</b>, which is a tool used by Wiifor.

                            <p  class="bd" style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 15px"> The idea of this method is to allow a more flexible development, establishing the next objectives and tasks based on the current advancement of the project. At the end of <b>each cycle (“sprint”) we should be able to have a small functioning part of what is the whole</b> system that we aim to achieve in the end. <br><br>
                            The idea also is to keep track of how the work was divided between the group and how much time was spent on each task. For the INSA’s rooms management project we used another tool to define our sprints, the <b>IceScrum</b>. One interesting feature of this project was the possibility of attributing certain “effort” values. In the figure below you can our backlog stories for the first INSA’s rooms management sprint.

                            Particularly, I found this to be one of the most interesting topics we studied this semester. The data is organized in such a way that it can be interpreted meaningfully without human intervention, in a way that: the data (symbols) can be seen as words and by establishing relationships between these words we can create meaning artificially. And the ontology can predict other relationships between those data, kind of like an artificial intelligence.

                                For the evaluation of the skills acquired during this module, we had to produce an analysis on an open-source dataset of our choice using <b>R as programming language</b>. For this work I teamed up with Diep Vu and we chose to work on a dataset of one of the most popular tv shows of all time and that we both liked, Game of Thrones. <br> <br>

                                From the dataset of the Game of Thrones episodes we could train our skills acquired during the TP lessons in a fun way at the same time extracting some curious data. <br> <br>

                        I found this part of the ISS teaching program particularly interesting, we could reflect not only on technical aspects of data treatment but also on how data can easily be manipulated to represent a point of view and how every data carries a subjectiveness. 
                            <br><br>I think I could reach a basic level in R language. I just wish we could have had <b>more well organised schedule</b> for this classes. It became clear to me during this course that this is certainly a topic I wish to master more.
